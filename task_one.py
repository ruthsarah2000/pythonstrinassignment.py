1. Product Review Analysis
Task 1: Keyword Highlighter
Write a program that searches through a series of product reviews for keywords such as "good", "excellent", "bad", 
"poor", and "average". Print out each review with the keywords in uppercase so they stand out.

Task 2: Sentiment Tally
Develop a function that tallies the number of positive and negative words in each review. Use a predefined list of positive and 
negative words to check against. The function should return the count of positive and negative words for each review.

Task 3: Review Summary
Implement a script that takes the first 50 characters of a review and appends "â€¦" to create a summary. Ensure that the summary does 
not cut off in the middle of a word.
